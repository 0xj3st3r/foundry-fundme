## Introduction

The **FundMe** smart contract facilitates crowdfunding by allowing users to contribute funds and become backers of a project. It enforces a minimum contribution amount, provides currency conversion, and allows the contract owner to manage funds.

## Features

- üåü Crowdfunding: Contribute funds to support projects.
- üí∞ Minimum Contribution: Requires a minimum contribution of 5 ETH (or equivalent in USD).
- üí± Currency Conversion: Utilizes the PriceConvertor library for accurate currency conversion.
- üí∏ Withdrawal: Contract owner can withdraw funds from the contract.
- üîê Access Control: Certain functions can only be executed by the contract owner.
- üìã Version Information: Get the version of the PriceFeed aggregator.

## Usage

### Installation

Welcome to the documentation for the FundMe Solidity Foundry Study Project! This guide will walk you through various commands and actions you can perform using the Solidity smart contract.

### Getting Started

To begin using the FundMe Solidity Foundry Study Project, make sure you have the necessary tools and dependencies installed.

### Commands

- `forge init`: Initialize a new foundry project.
- `forge fmt`: Auto format the code.
- `forge compile`: Compile a smart contract.
- `anvil`: Start a private chain.
- `forge create SimpleStorage --interactive`: Manually deploy a smart contract.
- `forge script script/DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol --rpc-url $RPC_URL --broadcast --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY`: Deploy a smart contract with a script.
- `cast send smart_contract_address "function_name(data_type)" data_value --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY`: Send a transaction.
  Example: `cast send 0x9fE46736679d2D9a65F0992F2272dE9f3c7fa6e0 "store(uint256)" 123 --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY`
- `cast call smart_contract_address "function_name(data_type)"`: Call a function to retrieve value.
  Example: `cast call 0x9fE46736679d2D9a65F0992F2272dE9f3c7fa6e0 "retrieve()"`
- `cast --to-base hex_value dec`: Convert hex data to decimal.
  Example: `cast --to-base 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000007b dec`
- `forge install package_name@version --no-commit`: Install packages and dependencies.
  Example: `forge install smartcontractkit/chainlink-brownie-contracts@0.6.1 --no-commit`
- `forge test --match-test test_function_name --fork-url url`: Run a particular test.
  Example: `forge test --match-test testPriceFeedVersionIsAccurate --fork-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`
- `forge coverage`: Check test coverage of the smart contract.
- `forge snapshot`: Check gas usage.
- `make deploy`: Deploy this project to the Anvil local chain.
